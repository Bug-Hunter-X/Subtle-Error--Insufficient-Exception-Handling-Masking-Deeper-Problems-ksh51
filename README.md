# Subtle Error: Insufficient Exception Handling Masking Deeper Problems

This repository demonstrates a common programming error where insufficient exception handling masks the root cause of errors.  The `bug.py` file shows a Python function that handles `KeyError` and `TypeError`, but this broad handling doesn't pinpoint why these exceptions are raised in the first place. A more robust solution is shown in `bugSolution.py`.

## Problem

The `bug.py` code attempts to access a dictionary key that may not exist and handles it with a generic exception handler. This can mask deeper issues with data validation or assumptions about the input's structure.  The code's resilience is misleadingâ€”it handles exceptions but fails to inform the developer about the true nature of the data issue.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.py` file provides a more robust solution. Instead of relying on general exception handling, it validates input data before accessing keys.  This improves the code's error detection and facilitates more informative error messages.
